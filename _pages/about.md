I finished my undergraduate studies at the University of Crete in Greece, and then completed my PhD at Michigan State University under the supervision of [Alexander Volberg](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander-Volberg). Currently, I am doing my postdoctoral studies at Julius-Maximilians-Universit채t W체rzburg in Germany.

My Research
======
includes Harmonic Analysis, Geometric Measure Theory and Dynamical Systems. I am interested in the decay rate of the Favard length of (random) Cantor sets and on certain one-phase problems. Currently, I am working on extending the known boundedness results of (weighted) Calder처n-Zygmund operators into the matrix-weighted setting.
